That's a great feature to have on your AI library website! You can modify your database schema to include a field that indicates whether a tool is accessible directly from your website or not. Here's an example of how your database schema could look like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE AI_Tools (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    website_link VARCHAR(255),
    launch_date DATE,
    rating DECIMAL(3,2),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    is_accessible BOOLEAN
);
```

In this schema, the `is_accessible` field is a boolean that indicates whether a tool is accessible directly from your website (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`). When displaying the tools on your website, you can check this field and provide the appropriate interface for each tool.

Remember, this is a simplified example. Depending on your exact requirements, you might need to adjust this schema or add more tables. I hope this helps! 😊

How to access public storage from react
Accessing files from Laravel's public storage in a React application using Inertia.js involves a few steps:

1. **Create a Symbolic Link**: Laravel's `public` directory is typically the document root of your web server. You can create a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public` by running the `php artisan storage:link` command³. This will make files in the `storage/app/public` directory accessible from the web.

2. **Access Files in React**: After creating the symbolic link, you can access the files in your React components using the `/storage/` path. For example, if you have an image named `image.jpg` in your `storage/app/public` directory, you can access it in your React component like this:

```jsx
<img src="/storage/image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

3. **Using Inertia.js**: If you're using Inertia.js and you want to pass data from your Laravel application to your React components, you can use the `Inertia::share` method⁵. This allows you to share data with your React components. However, this is typically used for sharing data, not files.

Remember, the `/storage/` path in the `src` attribute of the `img` tag corresponds to the `storage/app/public` directory in your Laravel application³.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. 😊

You can achieve this by using a custom hook or a component that introduces a delay in the rendering of your React components. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Delayed component
const Delayed = ({ children, waitBeforeShow = 2000 }) => {
  const [isShown, setIsShown] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsShown(true);
    }, waitBeforeShow);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [waitBeforeShow]);

  return isShown ? children : null;
};

// Usage
const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Delayed waitBeforeShow={2000}>
      <FirstComponent />
    </Delayed>
    <Delayed waitBeforeShow={4000}>
      <SecondComponent />
    </Delayed>
  </div>
);
```

In this example, `FirstComponent` will render after 2 seconds and `SecondComponent` will render 2 seconds after `FirstComponent`, i.e., 4 seconds after the initial render¹². Please replace `FirstComponent` and `SecondComponent` with your actual component names. This approach introduces a delay before the component is shown, which can be useful for sequencing the rendering of multiple components. Remember to import your components at the top of your file. 

Please note that this approach uses the `setTimeout` function, which can have implications for performance and user experience, so use it judiciously¹². Also, keep in mind that this is a simplified example and you might need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and the complexity of your components. If your components have dependencies on each other or if they need to share state, you might need a more complex solution. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 😊
